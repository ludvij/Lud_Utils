# Lud's C++ Util thingamathigs

This 'library' is meant for my own use and I don't promise code of any quality  whatsoever, I don't even know if this compiles at any moment.

Its inception came from me being tired of using fstream and reading some dude in stack overflow refering to 
reading a whole file as slurping it.

Then assert, parser and vec2 came as I was doint Advent of Code 2023.

## Usage

The whole library is contained in ```Lud``` namespace, they are single header lil' guys.

```c++
#define LUD_SLURPER_IMPLEMENTATION // define implementation 
#import "lud_slurper.hpp" // import just slurper
```

```c++
#import "lud_parser.hpp" // import just parser
```

```c++
#import "lud_assert.hpp" // import just assert
```

```c++
#import "lud_vec2.hpp" // import just vec2
```

```c++
#import "lud_types.hpp" // import just types
```
