# Lud's C++ Util thingamathigs

This 'library' is meant for my own use and I don't promise code of any quality whatsoever, I don't even know if this compiles at any moment.

Its inception came from me being tired of using fstream and reading some dude in stack overflow refer to 
reading a whole file as slurping it.

Then assert and parser  came as I was doing Advent of Code 2023.

Id came to be as I needed to trace lifetimes in EMOOs renderer.

Mem_stream contains streams implementation over a span or a vector.

## Usage

The whole library is contained in ```Lud``` namespace, they are single header lil' guys.  
In case its needed, it cames with a cmake lists to inmport whole thing as a project.
