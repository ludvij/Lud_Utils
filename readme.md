# Lud's C++ Util thingamathigs

This 'library' is meant for my own use and I don't promise code of any quality whatsoever, I don't even know if this compiles at any moment.

parser contains integer parsing functions and basic string manipulation on std::string and std::wstring  
assert contains a collection of asserts and checkers  
mem_stream contains a shallow implementation of istream over a std::span and a more thorough implementation over std::vector  
id will probably be deleted soon  

## Usage

The whole library is contained in ```Lud``` namespace, they are single header lil' guys.  
In case it is needed, it comes with a cmake lists to import whole thing as a project.
